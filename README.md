# MeanShift
  It is a unsupervised_learning classifier 

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
  The following project is a part of Innovaccer.Inc.
  Given a dataset of various people we need to train model in order to deduplicate the dataset.
  The project was made on Anaconda navigator's Spyder python IDE 3.2.6. using Anaconda package manager for all the dependecies.
# REQUIREMENTS
  pandas,
  scikit-learn,
  numpy
# HOW IT WORKS
Download the training set.
Place the path of the dataset in the program for classification.
run the program.
after executing the program output is produced in the console
# OUTPUT
Output is shown in console
# DRAWBACKS
Output data in the form of the numeric values.
# FUTURE WORK
Preprocessing the input data is not completely correct. so, Input data need to preprocessing more accurately for more accurate output.Need to convert numerical output data into string or into some format for human understanding.
